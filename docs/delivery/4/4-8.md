# 4-8 Frontend microVM Enhancements

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Enhance the frontend to better support Firecracker microVM workloads. Add file/archive upload support for submitting code as tar.gz archives (in addition to existing inline code), and display microVM-specific metadata (boot time, VM ID) in the workload detail view when available. Ensure the "microvm" isolation mode displays correctly in the UI when the Firecracker backend is registered.

## Requirements

1. **Archive upload** (workload submission form):
   - Add a file input (drag-and-drop zone) for `.tar.gz` archive upload alongside the existing code editor.
   - Toggle between "Inline Code" and "Upload Archive" modes.
   - When archive mode is selected, hide the code editor and show the file input.
   - Read the file as base64 and send as the `code` field (with a prefix marker, e.g., `base64:...`), or add a new `code_archive` field to the API request body.
   - Show file name and size after selection.
   - Validate file type (only .tar.gz accepted) and size (max 10MB).

2. **API extension** (Go backend):
   - Extend `POST /v1/workloads` and `POST /v1/workloads/async` to accept a `code_archive` field (base64-encoded tar.gz).
   - If `code_archive` is provided, it takes precedence over `code`.
   - Pass archive data through to the backend's `WorkloadSpec` (add `CodeArchive []byte` field).
   - Update the `WorkloadSpec` struct in `internal/backend/backend.go`.
   - Update API spec.

3. **Workload detail metadata**:
   - If the workload ran on the `microvm` isolation mode, show a "microVM Details" section in the detail view.
   - Display: isolation mode badge, runtime badge.
   - Future-proofed: when the backend populates metadata fields (boot time, VM ID), they'll display automatically.

4. **Backend list display**:
   - Verify the `/v1/backends` response correctly shows the Firecracker backend with its capabilities.
   - Ensure the workload form's isolation dropdown shows "microvm" with a descriptive label (e.g., "MicroVM (Firecracker)").

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `CodeArchive []byte` field to `WorkloadSpec` in `internal/backend/backend.go`.
2. Update API handlers to parse `code_archive` from request body.
3. Update API spec documentation.
4. Add archive upload UI component to the workload submission form.
5. Add inline/archive mode toggle.
6. Add microVM metadata section to workload detail view.
7. Verify backend list display with Firecracker registered.

## Test Plan

- **Archive upload UI**: Verify file input appears in archive mode, accepts .tar.gz, rejects other types, shows file info.
- **API extension**: POST with `code_archive` field → verify accepted and passed to backend spec.
- **Mode toggle**: Switch between inline and archive → verify correct input shown, other hidden.
- **Detail view**: Workload with isolation=microvm → verify metadata section renders.
- **Backend list**: With Firecracker registered → verify it appears in the isolation dropdown.
- **Playwright verification**: Submit workload via archive upload (if backend available) or inline code with microvm isolation.
