# [3-9] E2E CoS Test

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

End-to-end tests verifying all 8 acceptance criteria for PBI 3. Tests run against the real Next.js dev server connected to the Go API backend, using Playwright for browser-based verification.

## Status History

## Requirements

Verify each acceptance criterion end-to-end:

1. **AC1**: `pnpm dev` starts the Next.js development server and loads the dashboard.
2. **AC2**: Dashboard home page shows recent workloads and basic stats.
3. **AC3**: Workload submission form allows selecting runtime, isolation mode, entering code (with syntax highlighting), providing JSON input, and setting resource limits.
4. **AC4**: Submitting a workload calls the API and navigates to the workload detail page.
5. **AC5**: Workload list page shows all workloads with pagination and status filtering.
6. **AC6**: Workload detail page shows status, output, error, duration, isolation used, and metadata.
7. **AC7**: Workload detail page streams logs in real time via SSE when the workload is running.
8. **AC8**: The UI gracefully handles backends that aren't available yet (disabled options, clear messaging).

## Implementation Plan

1. **External Packages**: This task requires research and a guide document for: `@playwright/test`
2. Set up Playwright configuration in `web/` directory.
3. Create test setup that:
   - Starts the Go API server with a stub backend (reuse pattern from `api/test/e2e/`)
   - Starts the Next.js dev server
   - Runs Playwright tests against `http://localhost:3000`
4. Create `web/e2e/pbi3.spec.ts` with test cases for each AC:
   - **AC1**: Navigate to `/`, verify page loads with dashboard content.
   - **AC2**: Verify stats section and recent workloads section render with data.
   - **AC3**: Navigate to `/workloads/new`, verify all form fields present and functional.
   - **AC4**: Fill and submit form, verify navigation to detail page.
   - **AC5**: Navigate to `/workloads`, verify table, pagination controls, and status filters.
   - **AC6**: Navigate to workload detail, verify all fields displayed.
   - **AC7**: Submit a workload that emits logs, verify log lines appear in real time.
   - **AC8**: Verify isolation selector shows disabled options for unregistered backends.
5. Tear down servers after tests.

## Test Plan

### Objectives
Full end-to-end browser-based verification of all PBI 3 acceptance criteria.

### Environment & Setup
- Go API server running with stub backend(s) registered.
- Next.js dev server running at `http://localhost:3000` proxying to Go API.
- Playwright browser automation for all interactions.

### Test Scenarios
1. **AC1 — Dev server starts**: Navigate to root, verify page title and dashboard renders.
2. **AC2 — Dashboard stats**: Verify stats tiles and recent workloads section with data.
3. **AC3 — Submission form**: Verify runtime selector, isolation selector, code editor, JSON input, resource limits all present and interactive.
4. **AC4 — Submit workload**: Fill form, submit, verify redirect to `/workloads/[id]` with created workload.
5. **AC5 — Workload list**: Verify table, pagination, status filter toggles.
6. **AC6 — Detail view**: Verify status badge, output, error, duration, isolation, timestamps displayed.
7. **AC7 — Log streaming**: Submit workload with logs, verify log lines appear in log viewer.
8. **AC8 — Unavailable backends**: Verify disabled isolation options with appropriate messaging.

### Success Criteria
- All 8 tests pass.
- No console errors in the browser during tests.
- Pages load within reasonable time (<5s).
