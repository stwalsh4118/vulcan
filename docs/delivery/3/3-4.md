# [3-4] Dashboard Home Page

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build the dashboard home page at `/` showing recent workloads and aggregate statistics. This is the landing page and primary overview of the Vulcan system.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2026-02-19 05:13:20 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

1. Route: `/` (root page).
2. Stats overview section displaying data from `GET /v1/stats`:
   - Total workloads count
   - Counts by status (with color coding)
   - Counts by isolation mode
   - Average duration
3. Recent workloads section displaying last ~5 workloads from `GET /v1/workloads?limit=5`:
   - ID, status badge, runtime, isolation, created time
   - Each row links to `/workloads/[id]`
4. Quick action link to "New Workload" (`/workloads/new`).
5. Data fetched using React Query hooks from task 3-2.
6. Graceful loading and empty states.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `web/src/app/page.tsx` — dashboard home page.
2. Add stats cards/tiles section using `useStats()` hook.
3. Add recent workloads table/list using `useWorkloads({ limit: 5 })` hook.
4. Style with dark theme — cards with subtle borders, stats with accent colors.
5. Handle loading spinner and empty state ("No workloads yet").

## Test Plan

- Page renders without errors when API returns data.
- Page renders gracefully when API returns empty data.
- Stats display correct values from API.
- Recent workloads show with correct status badges and link to detail pages.
- TypeScript compilation passes.
