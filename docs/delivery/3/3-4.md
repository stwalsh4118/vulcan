# [3-4] Dashboard Home Page

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build the dashboard home page at `/` showing recent workloads and aggregate statistics. This is the landing page and primary overview of the Vulcan system.

## Status History

## Requirements

1. Route: `/` (root page).
2. Stats overview section displaying data from `GET /v1/stats`:
   - Total workloads count
   - Counts by status (with color coding)
   - Counts by isolation mode
   - Average duration
3. Recent workloads section displaying last ~5 workloads from `GET /v1/workloads?limit=5`:
   - ID, status badge, runtime, isolation, created time
   - Each row links to `/workloads/[id]`
4. Quick action link to "New Workload" (`/workloads/new`).
5. Data fetched using React Query hooks from task 3-2.
6. Graceful loading and empty states.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `web/src/app/page.tsx` — dashboard home page.
2. Add stats cards/tiles section using `useStats()` hook.
3. Add recent workloads table/list using `useWorkloads({ limit: 5 })` hook.
4. Style with dark theme — cards with subtle borders, stats with accent colors.
5. Handle loading spinner and empty state ("No workloads yet").

## Test Plan

- Page renders without errors when API returns data.
- Page renders gracefully when API returns empty data.
- Stats display correct values from API.
- Recent workloads show with correct status badges and link to detail pages.
- TypeScript compilation passes.

## Verification

- `pnpm build` succeeds with no errors.
- Stats section displays total, avg duration, counts by status (color-coded), counts by isolation.
- Recent workloads table shows last 5 with ID, status badge, runtime, isolation, created time.
- Each row links to `/workloads/[id]`.
- Empty state renders when no workloads exist.
- Loading states displayed while data fetches.
- Quick action "New Workload" link in page header.

## Files Modified

- `web/src/app/page.tsx` — complete dashboard home page implementation
