# [3-5] Workload List Page with Pagination & Filtering

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build the workload list page at `/workloads` with a paginated table of all workloads, status filtering, and navigation to detail pages.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|

## Requirements

1. Route: `/workloads`.
2. Paginated workload table using `GET /v1/workloads` with `limit` and `offset` query params:
   - Columns: ID, Status (badge), Runtime, Isolation, Created, Duration
   - Each row links to `/workloads/[id]`
3. Pagination controls (previous/next) reflecting `total`, `limit`, `offset` from the API response.
4. Status filter — allow filtering the displayed list by status (pending, running, completed, failed, killed, or all).
5. Data fetched using React Query hooks from task 3-2, re-fetching when filter or page changes.
6. Loading and empty states.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `web/src/app/workloads/page.tsx` — workload list page.
2. Add filter bar with status buttons/tabs (all, pending, running, completed, failed, killed).
3. Add workload table with columns and row links.
4. Add pagination controls using URL search params or local state.
5. Wire up `useWorkloads({ limit, offset })` hook with reactive params.
6. Note: Status filtering is client-side (API doesn't have a status filter param) — filter the returned list, or implement as URL state for future backend filtering support.

## Test Plan

- Page renders with workload table showing data from API.
- Pagination controls advance/retreat through pages correctly.
- Status filter narrows the displayed workloads.
- Empty state renders when no workloads match.
- Row clicks navigate to `/workloads/[id]`.
- TypeScript compilation passes.
