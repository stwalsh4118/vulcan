# [3-3] App Shell Layout & Navigation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build the root application shell with a sidebar navigation, consistent dark theme, and reusable UI components (status badges, page headers). This layout wraps all pages and provides the visual skeleton of the dashboard.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |

## Requirements

1. Root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) with:
   - Dark theme applied globally
   - Sidebar navigation with links: Dashboard (`/`), Workloads (`/workloads`), New Workload (`/workloads/new`)
   - Active link highlighting
   - App title/branding ("Vulcan")
2. Reusable UI components:
   - `StatusBadge` — color-coded badge for workload status (pending=yellow, running=blue, completed=green, failed=red, killed=gray)
   - `PageHeader` — consistent page title styling
3. Desktop-first responsive layout — sidebar collapses or stacks on narrow viewports.
4. Consistent typography and spacing using Tailwind utility classes.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `web/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — navigation sidebar.
2. Create `web/src/components/ui/StatusBadge.tsx` — status badge with color mapping.
3. Create `web/src/components/ui/PageHeader.tsx` — page header component.
4. Update `web/src/app/layout.tsx` to include sidebar and main content area.
5. Style with Tailwind — dark backgrounds, border accents, monospace touches for the infra aesthetic.

## Test Plan

- Layout renders with sidebar and main content area.
- Navigation links point to correct routes.
- StatusBadge renders correct colors for all 5 statuses (pending, running, completed, failed, killed).
- TypeScript compilation passes.
