# [2-6] Log Streaming via SSE

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement real-time log streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Backends write log lines to a broker during execution; the SSE handler reads and pushes them to connected clients via `GET /v1/workloads/:id/logs`.

## Requirements

1. Create `internal/engine/logbroker.go` with a `LogBroker` struct:
   - `Subscribe(workloadID string) (<-chan string, func())` — returns a channel of log lines and an unsubscribe function.
   - `Publish(workloadID string, line string)` — send a log line to all subscribers.
   - `Close(workloadID string)` — signal that no more logs will be sent (workload finished); close all subscriber channels.
2. Thread-safe: multiple subscribers, concurrent publish/subscribe.
3. Integrate with the execution engine: pass the log broker to backends via `WorkloadSpec` or a writer interface so backends can emit log lines during execution.
4. Add `GET /v1/workloads/:id/logs` SSE endpoint:
   - Content-Type: `text/event-stream`
   - Each log line sent as an SSE `data:` event
   - Stream closes when workload finishes or client disconnects
   - If workload is already completed, return existing logs (if any) and close
5. Handle client disconnect gracefully (context cancellation).

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `api/internal/engine/logbroker.go`:
   - `LogBroker` struct with `sync.RWMutex`, map of workload ID → subscriber list
   - `NewLogBroker() *LogBroker`
   - `Subscribe()`, `Publish()`, `Close()` methods
   - Each subscriber is a buffered channel
2. Add a `LogWriter` interface or callback to `WorkloadSpec` so backends can write logs.
3. Update `Engine.execute()` to:
   - Create a log writer that publishes to the broker
   - Pass it to the backend
   - Call `broker.Close(workloadID)` when execution finishes
4. Create `api/internal/api/logs.go`:
   - `handleStreamLogs` SSE handler
   - Set SSE headers, subscribe to broker, flush each line
   - Handle client disconnect via `r.Context().Done()`
5. Update `api/internal/api/server.go`:
   - Accept `*engine.LogBroker` as a dependency (or access via engine)
   - Add `GET /v1/workloads/{id}/logs` route
6. Write unit tests for log broker and integration tests for SSE endpoint.

## Test Plan

### Objectives
Verify real-time log delivery, multi-subscriber support, and graceful cleanup.

### Key Scenarios
1. **Single subscriber**: Publish 3 log lines → subscriber receives all 3 in order.
2. **Multiple subscribers**: Two subscribers both receive all published lines.
3. **Close**: After Close(), subscriber channels are closed (range loop exits).
4. **Late subscriber**: Subscriber joins after some lines published → receives only subsequent lines.
5. **SSE endpoint**: GET /v1/workloads/:id/logs returns text/event-stream, receives log lines as `data:` events.
6. **Client disconnect**: Client closes connection → no goroutine leak, subscriber cleaned up.
7. **Completed workload**: GET logs for already-completed workload → stream closes immediately.

### Success Criteria
- Log lines arrive in order.
- No goroutine leaks after workload completion or client disconnect.
- SSE format is correct (data: prefix, double newline between events).
