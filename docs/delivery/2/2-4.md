# [2-4] Backend Registry & Auto-Routing

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build a backend registry that holds registered backends, resolves `auto` isolation mode to the appropriate backend based on runtime/format, validates that a requested isolation backend is available, and exposes registered backends via `GET /v1/backends`.

## Requirements

1. Create `internal/backend/registry.go` with a `Registry` struct.
2. `Register(name string, b Backend)` — register a backend by name.
3. `Resolve(isolation, runtime string) (Backend, error)` — resolve which backend to use:
   - If isolation is `auto`: JS/TS runtime → isolate, OCI runtime → gVisor, archive/other → microVM.
   - If isolation is explicit: look up by name, return error if not registered.
4. `List() []BackendInfo` — return all registered backends with their capabilities.
5. Define `BackendInfo` struct: name + capabilities.
6. Add `GET /v1/backends` endpoint to the API server returning the list of registered backends and capabilities.
7. Wire the registry into the API server (accept it as a dependency).

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `api/internal/backend/registry.go`:
   - `Registry` struct with `map[string]Backend`
   - `NewRegistry() *Registry`
   - `Register()`, `Resolve()`, `List()` methods
   - Auto-routing map: runtime → default isolation
2. Create `api/internal/api/backends.go`:
   - `handleListBackends` handler returning registered backends
3. Update `api/internal/api/server.go`:
   - Accept `*backend.Registry` as a dependency in `NewServer`
   - Add `GET /v1/backends` route
4. Update `api/cmd/vulcan/main.go` to create and pass registry.
5. Write unit tests for registry and endpoint.

## Test Plan

- Test `Register` and `List`: register multiple backends, verify all appear in list with correct capabilities.
- Test `Resolve` with explicit isolation: registered backend returns successfully; unregistered returns error.
- Test `Resolve` with `auto` isolation:
  - runtime=node → resolves to isolate
  - runtime=oci → resolves to gvisor
  - runtime=go → resolves to microvm
- Test `Resolve` auto when target backend not registered returns error.
- Test `GET /v1/backends` endpoint returns 200 with correct JSON structure.
